        <section id="project1">
            <h2>Project 1 - Starship Research</h2>
            <p>This project explored the challenges and opportunities in campus delivery systems using Starship robots. My contributions included:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Conducted interviews and documented user frustrations with delivery speed, app reliability, and order accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Proposals:</strong> Developed innovative solutions like 'Tour Guide Starships' for campus navigation and 'Guardian Starships' with facial recognition for safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Insights:</strong> Highlighted the need for improved routing algorithms and real-time communication to reduce delivery times.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Presented a vision for smarter, safer, and more efficient robot delivery networks, potentially transforming campus logistics.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <section id="project2">
            <h2>Project 2 - Embodied Shopping</h2>
            <p>This project aimed to redefine the in-store shopping experience using augmented reality (AR). My work included:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concept Ideation:</strong> Developed the Smart Cart Companion, an early concept for personalized, tech-enhanced shopping carts.</li>
                <li><strong>Journey Mapping:</strong> Created user journey maps to identify pain points and optimize customer experience in physical retail environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Prototyping:</strong> Contributed to the Figma design of the virtual shopping assistant interface, including real-time stock tracking and product recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflections:</strong> Gained insights into the challenges of blending digital and physical shopping experiences.</li>
            </ul>
